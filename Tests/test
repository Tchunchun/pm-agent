Topic: Deniel Intelligence Model Requirement 

Objective: Customer has shared the business requirement for the Deniel Intelligence, and more specifically, the models that they need help with. 

Here is the meeting notes from SME: 

"the specific area he called out for Microsoft’s help is:
Denial prediction when there is no direct payer connection.

More precisely, he said:

For correct coding, Optum can rely on an existing UHC Precheck API, so prediction isn’t needed there.
The gap is when Optum does not have a direct payer connection.
In those cases, Optum wants to use historical claims data to predict whether a claim will be denied.
Fintan explicitly noted that this is where Microsoft can really help move things along, i.e., with advanced analytics / modeling on historical data to enable denial prediction.
So the MSFT value-add he highlighted is AI/ML-driven denial prediction based on historical data, especially for payers without real-time APIs.”



So, I’d like to discuss the requirement and define the model requirements. 


Output: 
- draft model requirement
- follow up questions with customer.
