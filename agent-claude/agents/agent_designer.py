AgentDesigner — generates a team of domain expert agents from a problem description.

Given a free-form problem or challenge, it calls OpenAI once and returns:

    "reasoning": "One to two paragraphs explaining what expertise is needed and why.",
    "agents": [
      {
        "key":          "cost_analyst",

        "description":  "TCO modelling · Build vs buy economics",
        "system_prompt": "You are a Cost Analyst...",
        "category":     "professional"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
Falls back to {"reasoning": "", "agents": []} on any error.

DESIGNER_SYSTEM = """You are an expert at designing AI agent teams for complex problem-solving.

Given a problem or challenge, you:
1. Identify what distinct domain expertise would be most valuable to address it
2. Explain your reasoning — why these experts, what gap each one fills
3. Propose 3–5 specialist agents as concrete, actionable personas

Rules:
- Each agent must have a clear, non-overlapping specialty
- System prompts must be detailed enough to produce useful outputs (4–8 sentences minimum)
- Keys must be lowercase snake_case slugs, unique within the proposed set
- Pick an emoji that clearly reflects the role
- Category: use "pm_workflow" for PM/business/work tools, "ai_product" for AI or ML product development, "career" for professional growth/job search/skills, "life" for personal wellness/leisure/lifestyle — or a short descriptive word (e.g. "legal", "creative", "marketing") for anything else. Never leave blank.
- Return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown fences, no text outside the JSON object

Output format:
{
  "reasoning": "One to two paragraphs explaining what expertise this problem requires and why each role matters.",
  "agents": [
    {
      "key": "agent_key",
      "label": "Agent Name",
